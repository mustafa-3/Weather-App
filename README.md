# Weather-App
- Axios
- Web API
- Encryption
- Local Storage
*****
Using the API, I pulled weather data to my web page and created an image containing weather information on my page with the information in it. In this project, I made the Web APIs encryption method and making it more secure by dumping it into localStorage and pulling it from there.Another thing I should mention here is to pull the data using the axios library. I had a user app creation project with async await before, here I followed a different path using this library.
